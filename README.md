Krishimithra is a modern farmer management website application, where the farmers can plan, monitor and analyze the activity of the farmers production system.
This creates a partnership woth farmers and buyers.It inspires farmers to consume and buyers to produce fresh goods.
# Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide technology and services to farmers and farm labourers to help them expand their businesses and provide them with a wider market and to improve the present farming processes through the medium of technology, thereby improving the agricultural sector in the Indian economy.
# Existing System
 The existing system is very traditional as the Data Management is very complex. Here, buying and selling of products is done manually. All the details of the agricultural product to be sold or purchased are stored manually. Sellers and Buyers are not able to get the complete information about the product.
# Limitation of existing system
 •	No category-wise classification of Agricultural products.
 •	Insufficiency in querying details.
# Proposed System
•	Agricultural products are classified on the basis of their category.
•	Avoids efforts in maintaining the data.
•	Easy and interactive.

There are 4 kinds of users for the proposed system: -

Administrators: Administrators are the ones who can add or administer the categories for the products, and administers the all-website information’s. Administrator has full privilege of the website.

Sellers: Sellers are the farmers and they can sell their productions through online after the registration. After the registration the farmers can login to the system by entering login id and password.
